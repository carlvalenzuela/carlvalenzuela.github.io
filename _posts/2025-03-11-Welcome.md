Hi, it's Carl! I recently graduated from UP Diliman with a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering.

I created this website to document my work as I continue to learn and improve my skills.

My main interests are in Machine Learning and Data Analytics. I am also exploring ways to combine my technical knowledge in tech with my passion for art.

Excited to share what I come up with and see what's ahead of this journey :>
